          “Shy in Jakarta” is a multimedia installation and recording project engaging sound art, poetry and multichannel video to address problems of Chinese diaspora, identity and self-concept.  The work focuses on a 45 minute audio-piece that is first crafted as a studio recording. The piece will be performed live within the world of video components projection-mapped onto 3 walls of a space. The videos will be centered on 3D renderings of an imaginary room with the moving elements of 3D sculpture, live footage, and visual synthesis. The piece draws from work such as””””””              . In some concave version, Shy in Jakarta seeks to fill a space with material and objects that belong both to inherited memory and collective cultural narratives, in order to better understand the intersection of these seemingly opposite spaces in an oblique encounter with the self.

          The installation draws from my experience as a first generation Chinese American woman, the result of ancestral diaspora throughout Asia spurred by the Cultural Revolution. The name “Shy in Jakarta” is derived from my childhood memories of being told bedtime stories by my mother about her childhood. Born in Jakarta to refugees of the cultural revolution, she internalized a relatively brief but vivid experience of a place that she was not ethnically native to and which she again had to flee during the Indonesian Mass Killings of 1965-66. This piece seeks to explore the intersections of racial identity and iconography, cultural material and propaganda, as the Chinese genocide during the Indonesian coup was related to a conflation of Communist sympathy with Chinese ethnicity.

          The goal of Shy in Jakarta is to place the viewer into an immersive space that will serve as a site from which to integrate and explore inherited cultural memory and collective racial myth and iconography.  As we at once become increasingly sensitive and desensitized to a longstanding national history of cultural appropriation and begin to deconstruct the ever-present white gaze in the American socio political discourse, I want to address how these histories are still operative in my self-concept as a first generation Chinese American.

          While Shy in Jakarta will be performed as a multi-media, spatial experience, it is first and foremost an audio piece, using a foundation of sound to engender a heightened exploration of ambiguous psycho-emotional space. The piece plays with how music and sound have the power to act as ether, synthesizing space and disparate objects within it into a narrative, cinematic experience, thereby speaking to the constructed nature of identity and the elements with which it is constructed. Shy in Jakarta draws from musique concrete, poetry, ambient and experimental styles, highlighting at once somatic and ethereal nature of experience and memory. Utilizing analog audio synthesis and digital manipulation as material, it will incorporate additional poetic vocals and field recordings into the soundscapes at times to weave the presence of narrative and place.

          Scrawled on the wall of the imaginary room are fictitious “Chinese characters.” Small details will appear inconsistent among the depictions of different angles of the room, suggesting the dreamlike nature of memory and how it pieces things together subjectively, spatially, and nonlinearly, piece-by-piece, rather than objectively and holistically. Moving elements, produced via analog visual synthesis, raw footage, and abstract 3D sculptural elements will appear, disappear, and reappear throughout the piece. These will represent “ghosts” of sorts– energies and emotions that temporarily inhabit and direct meaning to the space and objects of the world. Similarly, the mirrors and doubles in the installation remind us of the contradictions inherent in the construction of non-white American identity.

          The work will investigate 3-Dimensionality as it suggests individuation and transcendence of archetype and cultural myth.  The 3D space is very loosely inspired by an imagining of the bedroom of Mata Hari, a famous early 20th century Dutch orientalist socialite and performance artist. The irony is that exoticized Chinese imagery and material and its myriad implications is as much a part of my experience as childhood and familial memory. The videos will be projection-mapped onto three walls of a white room/theater, as if they project outward into extendable space, suggesting the bleeding together of personal and social. This is the effect of fusion: the smearing of identity.
