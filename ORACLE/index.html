		ORACLE /ˈôrək(ə)l/: a clear glass straw collapsing past, present and future; <br>a site of decolonization of TIME.</p>
		A node of our evolutionary divergence from other primates is identified in the moment human cognition developed the ability for PROSPECTION, or, MENTAL TIME-TRAVEL. We simulate, we plan, we predict, we intend. Foresight is key to the particular way we make decisions. 
  		<br><br>
  		STILL WE ARE HAUNTED by a lack of agency. It is humanity's embarrassment, Achille's Heel- our inability to see around the next corner. A sense of control reincarnates in the form of superstition: an imagined link between certain actions or psychic phenomena and specific effects in the external world. Collectively we pour a vast amount of energy into knowing the unknowable. In certain areas we seem to actually have some sort of edge. We huddle behind the lanterns of our world class fortune-telling experts. But prediction is ultimately a strenuous, difficult, and largely innaccurate business.

  		<p style="color:yellow; font-style: italic;">WHY DOES TIME BEAR A VISCERAL LIKENESS TO BONDAGE? <br>HOW CAN WE REIMAGINE OUR RELATIONSHIP TO FATHER (TIME)?</p>
  		This Oracle is a psuedo-randomized algorithm that spits back borrowed phrases from a selection of writings on sci fi, metereological observations, linguistic theory, afrofuturism, music journalism, stock trading advice, election analysis, scientific doomsday statements, ancient prophecy, and appropriates its poetic structure from the classical Chinese text, the I Ching. Who is to say what invisible hand guides its number generation?

  		The Oracle is willing to engage. You may put forth a question.<br><p style="color:yellow; font-style: italic;"> ( Your question does not have any programmatic connection to the pseudo-random numbers that decide what garbled poetry you receive. Can studying the patterns in HISTORY reveal what strings connect the pensive quicksilver of your psycho-emotional yearnings to the algorithm's selection? )</p>
