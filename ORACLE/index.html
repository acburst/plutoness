		ORACLE /ˈôrək(ə)l/: a medium- a clear glass straw- collapsing past, present and future; divination as a site to study and decolonize TIME.
		<br><br>
		The evolution of human cognition supposedly diverged from that of our monkey relatives and Stone Age predecessors when we developed the ability to project into the future. This ability for PROSPECTION, or, MENTAL TIME-TRAVEL, plays into our sense of motivation and functionality: We simulate, we plan, we predict, we intend. Our apparent gift of foresight is so key to our Specialness that whether or not other animals have the ability to prospect is considered controversial. 
  		<br><br>
  		Belief in precognition is observed to correlated with feeling a lack of agency. And in a larger sense, it is humanity's embarrassment, our Achille's Heel- our inability to see around the next corner. But control is reincarnated in the form of superstition: an imagined link between certain personal actions or psychic phenomena and specific effects in the external world, present or future. We have collectively poured a vast amount of energy into trying to gain control of the uncontrollable, trying to know the unknowable. In some areas of knowledge we seem to actually have some sort of edge. We huddle behind the lanterns of our world class fortune-telling experts. But prediction is ultimately a strenuous and difficult business, full of pitfalls and delusions, and of course, mistakes. At least we are certain we can't change the past. And certainly death is irrefutable. 
  		<br><br>
  		But what is the source of our feeling this lack of agency? Why does time bear a visceral likeness to bondage and oppression? How can we reimagine our relationship to time in order to renegotiate our assumptions? This Oracle is a psuedo-randomized algorithm that spits back pieces of text from writings of science fiction, meteorological observations, linguistic theory, afrofuturism, election analysis, scientific doomsday predictions, and stock trading advice. And who is to say what invisible hand guides its pseudorandom number generation?
  		<br><br>
  		But first things first:

  		The Oracle has consented to answering. You may put forth a question.<br><br> (Understand that your question does not have any programmatic connection to the pseudo-random numbers that decide what lines of text are spit back at you, but who are we to say what invisible strings connect the pensive quicksilver of your psycho-emotional yearnings and the pseudorandom selections? Perhaps if you study the connection long enough, a pattern will begin to emerge. Consult the HISTORY for further study.)
