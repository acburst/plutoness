            This room is an exploration of a certain sort of nihilism. Beneath apparent order, the universe is a mess of infinite possibility, spilling like stuffing out of the seams of a tightly sewn surface. When truly confronted, this world of profuse randomness and whimsy can become a source of paralyzing fear. The responsibility to create order and meaning from this confusion of abundance falls squarely on the individual. This is the most daunting task life asks of you: to have authority over your choices and what you give your attention to. It's almost enough to make you sick. It's almost enough to make you want to lock yourself in your room and never come back out.

            The bedroom is a place of comfort, a symbol of the most internal rung of the emotional life and the psyche. It is a place where entering chaos can be done in a safe way, on a deceptively intimate scale. To begin with the most basic of motions, to grope in the dark for the unshakeable bricks of self, leads to an understanding of how your own nature can serve as a guide through the chaotic waters of both the external world and the unconscious. This growing sense of your own naturalness of being is a compass to help avoid the perils of everything's opulence; without the unifying forces of purpose and presence, such potential threatens to overwhelm and benumb.
            <br><br>

            "Even Water Can Kill You" explores: the first ataxic steps into entropy, shyness and solitude, the richness and warmth of the internal world, and yet also the strange sense of confinement within yourself, the lonesomeness of your own imagination. Chang uses a mix of both natural and synthetic found materials, paint, textile, paper mache, music and video to dissolve the boundary between organic growth and deliberate construction, giving tentative form to and prioritizing the personal, inner, immaterial sources of intuition and self-discovery.

            VIEWERS are encouraged to lie on a bed to watch the entirety of this video, which is projected on the patterned tin ceiling, like a distorted astral projection of a dreaming body. The video accesses a peaceful, formless patience through simple imagery, evoking the shape of a circle by its perpetual inward motion. The no-thingness that this movement eventually reaches is an opportunity to begin anew: to fully experience the most unadorned forms of beauty. The video is played on loop along with a separate soundtrack, which is also looping, providing atmosphere for the entire room.
