		ORACLE /ˈôrək(ə)l/: a medium through whom advice or prophecy was sought from the gods in classical antiquity.
		<br><br>
		The evolution of human cognition diverges from that of our monkey relatives and Stone Age predecessors in the ability to project into the future. This ability for PROSPECTION, or, MENTAL TIME-TRAVEL, plays into our sense of motivation and functionality: We simulate, we plan, we predict, we intend. Our apparent gift of foresight is so key to our sense of specialness that whether or not other animals also possess the ability to see themselves in the future is hotly contested. 
  		<br><br>
  		COVID-19 has devastated human society and taken 1.62 million human lives. Yet the earth is peaceful; there has been a calming of global seismographic tremors. The air is cleaner, the birds are louder. The oceans are quieter and less polluted. Greenhouse Gas Emissions have decreased. Why do we continue to cling to the idea that we know what is best for all of life?
  		<br><br>
  		In this time of great precariousness humanity's need for certainty is more starkly laid out for all to see. A lack of control is observed to cause people to reach for belief in precognition. It is here, in the pit of the dark night of the control-freak soul, that a surrogate, illusory sense of control is restablished, in the form of superstition: an imagined link between certain personal actions or psychic phenomena and specific effects in the external world, present or future. But our need to have authority over life is not unique to pandemic-time. It is an Achille's Heel of embarrassing powerlessness, our inability to see around the next corner. We have collectively poured a vast amount of energy into trying to gain control of the uncontrollable, trying to know the unknowable. In some areas of expertise we seem to actually have some sort of edge. In times of great collective danger, we huddle behind the lanterns of our forerunning future-envisioning experts. But predicting the future is ultimately a difficult business, full of pitfalls and delusions, and of course, mistakes. At least we are certain we can't change the past.

  		The Pythia, the resident high priestess also known as the Oracle of Delphi, chewed and smoked Oleander leaves inducing violent and sometimes fatal epilectic symptoms and channeling to the gift of vision, the spirit of Apollo. It is said that the position generally truncated a Pythia's life. This Oracle is a psuedo-randomized algorithm that spits back pieces of text from sources of science fiction, meteorological observations, linguistic theory, scientific socio-political predictions, and stock trading advice. But who is to say what invisible hand guides its pseudorandom number generation?
  		<br><br>
  		Does this Oracle possess some variety of consciousness? Should they automatically work for you, of the superior consciousness? Do you commune with the divine? Can you surf the undulations of pseudorandomness? Is knowledge always ours to demand? Maybe you should let the Oracle decide.

  		The Oracle has consented to answering. You may put forth a question.<br><br> (Understand that your question does not have any programmatic connection to the pseudo-random numbers that decide what lines of text are spit back at you, but who are we to say what invisible strings connect the pensive quicksilver of your psycho-emotional yearnings and the pseudorandom selections? Perhaps if you study the connection long enough, a pattern will begin to emerge. Consult the HISTORY for further study.)
